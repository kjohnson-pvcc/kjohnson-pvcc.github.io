<ul>
<li>Requirements Analysis - the software life cycle starts here, the goal is to specify what services the proposed system will provide, identify any conditions on those services, and define how the world will interact with the system.</li> 
<li>Design - this step involves creating a plan for the construction of the proposed system.</li>
<li>Implementation - involves writing the programs, creating the data files and developing the databases.</li>
<li>Testing - testing in the past was the process of debugging programs and confirming the final product was compatible with the software requirements, however today testing may be incorporated into other steps.</li>
